Which extension point or listener is called upon the first launch or install of My plugin?
I trying to use:
<applicationListeners>
    <listener class="MyListener" topic="com.intellij.ide.plugins.DynamicPluginListener"/>
    <listener class="MyListener" topic="com.intellij.ide.plugins.PluginStateListener"/>
</applicationListeners>
but it don't handle my plugin,
Also I try to check:
InstalledPluginsState.getInstance().installedPlugins
But it don't contains my plugin.
I want to execute some startup script only once - then IDE install my plugin, or plugin run first time (edited)

The earliest phase, where one can do something computationally interesting regarding the environment  is com.intellij.ide.ApplicationInitializedListener#componentsInitialized it get’s called right after all the depending plugins of your Ide plugin are loaded and their services and component’s.
There are also PreloadingActivities , ApplicationListener , depending on the lifecycle  phase you’re trying to target.

If registering those doesn’t work in the plugin.xml. I would suggest registering a Listener early enough to register the corresponding Topic to the MessageBus.
