/**
 * Provides notification to all opened IDEA windows that the user has disabled the Key Promoter X balloons in one of the
 * tool-windows.
 * <p>
 * In depth explanation: With one IDEA running, you can have several projects (and windows) opened. Each IDEA window
 * gets its own instance of the panel inside the Key Promoter X tool-window and therefore changes need to be synchronized
 * among all tool-window instances. When someone enables the "disable notifications" checkbox, this change needs to be
 * published to all other tool-windows. Therefore, all Key Promoter X tool-windows subscribe to
 * {@link Handler#SNOOZE_TOPIC} and when in one of them the "disable notification" checkbox is clicked, it calls
 * {@link #setSnoozed(boolean)} which notifies all other subscribers about the change.
 * </p>
